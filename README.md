## Rei Discord Bot!

Remaking the discord bot I made in 2020!

If you wish to use the code just remember to switch the token on the config file.

To use it you also need to Open node.js and go to the bot directory and type:
npm install discord.js --save

To launch it type:
node .

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file you're reading.

← `index.js`: This is the main file with the main menu.

← `Commands Folder`: This folder contains all the commands, if you wish to make a new one, add here.

← `config.json`: This file is where you add your token and choose the prefix.

← `package.json`: A file that lists your discord.js version and other stuff.
